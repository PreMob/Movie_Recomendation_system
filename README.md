# 🎬 Movie Recommendation System

## 📌 Overview
The **Movie Recommendation System** is a web app built with **Streamlit** that suggests movies based on user input. The system uses **machine learning** and **natural language processing (NLP)** techniques to find similar movies and display their posters in a user-friendly interface.

## 🚀 Features
- 🎥 **Search for a movie** from a dropdown list.
- 🔥 **Get 5 similar movie recommendations** based on content similarity.
- 🖼 **Displays movie posters** fetched from **TMDB API**.
- 🎨 **Modern UI** with an attractive design and smooth animations.

## 🏗️ Tech Stack
- **Python** 🐍
- **Streamlit** (for web UI) 🌐
- **Pandas & NumPy** (for data processing) 📊
- **Scikit-learn** (for ML-based recommendations) 🤖
- **TMDB API** (for fetching movie posters) 🖼

## 📂 Installation & Setup
### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/movie-recommender.git

```

## 🔧 How It Works
1. The user selects a movie from the dropdown.
2. The app finds similar movies using a pre-trained **content-based filtering** model.
3. It fetches movie posters using the **TMDB API**.
4. The recommendations are displayed with titles and posters in a sleek UI.

## 🛠️ Future Improvements
- ⭐ **Add user-based recommendations** using collaborative filtering.
- 📊 **Improve similarity calculations** with deep learning models.
- 🌍 **Allow filtering by genre, year, or language.**
